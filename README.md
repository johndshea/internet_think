# "What does the internet think of this thing?"

Basically, this is an app that will tell you what the internet thinks of just about anything. It uses various APIs to give you the authoritative "Internet's opinion" of just about any word or phrase.

It pulls from the following APIs:

Giphy
Google Trends (not technically an API)
